# Portable SBC Shell
Single board computer enclosure with attached keyboard plate and compartment for batteries. 

The side compartments support BL-5C type batteries and pathways are made to the center compartment which can hold the main electronics. The case is meant to be assmbled without any screws. The lower cover can be removed by inserting a pin through the holes of the case to push the tabs in.
